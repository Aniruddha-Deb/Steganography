so if we do a FFT now, we'll need to:
- split the matrix into three (or four) matrices and do an fft individually
- encode into each of the matrices
- take an inverse fft
for decoding:
- take the fft of the split matrices, 
- decode from the sequence (picking values from each of the four)
- decrypt with password etc etc

will need quite a bit of code + changing the block diagrams in the presentation rn

IF they ask us how this si related to signals and systems, maybe we can say this?

basically our systems are non-LTI (whatever systems there are in our block diagram). uspe stress kar denge 
they're still systems (take input give output)

@Tanish
Nonce explanation

Uska timer is actually for 10 min :/
the person in front of us
sir said 10 min max initially today
i think we'll have to come again at some other time

why do I think I've seen these programs before?
Quantum global summer school..

kuch nahi bola :'(
"I'm taking a course in this later in the summer - quantum computing and machine learning, and I'm using the same code so I realized"
Bruh. We wrote our code by hand!
